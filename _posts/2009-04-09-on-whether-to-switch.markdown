==========
This is the problem (that I see) with blogs. They come down to being not very customizable. If you use any system for a long period of time, it ends up being either too big, too small, or just too much the same. Blog sites try to compensate for this by offering a choice of themes, but it doesn't really help. People just want change. In this case, I heard about a git + markdown + jekyll solution that seemed nice, and then here I am. It sounded cool. It *is* cool. But not very productive for those who are trying to keep track of my blog. Of course, it may just be my imagination that these people exist, but I suppose that's not as important. A blog should be accessible, regardless of whether people actually do access it.

If I do decide to keep this, I'll probably make a link from the old blog over here. The nice thing is, I won't ever (hopefully) lose content from this one, because using git, I have a full local copy as well as it being stored on github. Also, since it's a plain-text format, I can import (or export) anything here, provided I give it enough time. I'll probably try to import my livejournal posts at some point to see how feasible it is. It'll also give me more markdown experience, and I enjoy markdown.

I also have a TODO list for this blog:
* Get RSS working
* Make the front page show a few posts. I prefer this style of showing posts. The page-at-a-time version should be doable alongside also.
* Retouch the CSS. Right now its just a straight copy of Mojombo's css. I'd like to fix that.
* Add more links. It'd be nice to actually have the page filled out completely.

We'll see how this goes!
